There are areas of my life that I feel are not complete.\nI find pleasure and fulfillment from working towards completion.  I recognize\nan impulsiveness that can often take away/distract me from completion.  I also notice\nfood/taking snack breaks as a method/manifestation of this tendancy.  When I get\nclose or have the opportunity to be with my self, the best thing I can do is to sit with, listen to,\nreflect on, write about, and/or learn from whatever is here.  I have been feeling incomplete &#x26; detached\nbecause I have not been spending time with my self when the perfect opportunities arise.\nI am the keys to my own success, I am the answers to all the seemingly tough questions.  I am the roadmap through life's\njourney. I am exactly what I want, and the best skill to be improving is being me;\nfollowing my dreams, my passions, my interests, my truths, and my desires.  Everything else is an illusion.</p>",timeToRead:1,excerpt:"How do I want/intend to live my life?
