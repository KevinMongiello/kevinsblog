I intend to live my life
comfortably, pleasurably, motivated by love, and doing things that
give me satisfaction.  Living from a beautiful, bountiful, abundant state of mind.
I like feeling complete.  There are areas of my life that I feel are not complete.
I find pleasure and fulfillment from working towards completion.  I recognize
an impulsiveness that can often take away/distract me from completion.  I also notice
food/taking snack breaks as a method/manifestation of this tendancy.  When I get
close or have the opportunity to be with my self, the best thing I can do is to sit with, listen to,
reflect on, write about, and/or learn from whatever is here.  I have been feeling incomplete &amp;#x26; detached
because I have not been spending time with my self when the perfect opportunities arise.
I am the keys to my own success, I am the answers to all the seemingly tough questions.  I am the roadmap through life&apos;s
journey. I am exactly what I want, and the best skill to be improving is being me;
following my dreams, my passions, my interests, my truths, and my desires.  Everything else is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Morning Routine]]></title><description><![CDATA[Starting a new day.  Meditation & journaling is how i intend to start every day.

Meditation &amp;#x26; journaling is how i intend to start every day.
Getting the pinpoint accuracy of what my targets; Letting go of any stressors.
Taking some itme to figure out what I want to say to myself.  Who I am today, what is present for me.
If there is anything I&apos;d like to focus on or know about my condition today, etc.
I usually get really bored with morning routines, and this is a good way to really spice it up.
I can write anything &amp;#x26; I am just giving space for everything/anything to develop, instead of the same motions every monring.
I can tap into the infinite to start my day.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
