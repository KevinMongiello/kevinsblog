Starting a new day.  Meditation & journaling is how i intend to start every day.
Getting the pinpoint accuracy of what my targets; Letting go of any stressors.
Taking some itme to figure out what I want to say to myself.  Who I am today, what is present for me.
If there is anything I'd like to focus on or know about my condition today, etc.
I usually get really bored with morning routines, and this is a good way to really spice it up.
I can write anything & I am just giving space for everything/anything to develop, instead of the same motions every monring.
I can tap into the infinite to start my day.
